Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra	[F]or what constitutes the tremendous historical uniqueness of that [[Persian people|Persian]] is just the opposite of this. Zarathustra was the first to consider the fight of good and evil the very wheel in the machinery of things: the transposition of morality into the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realm, as a force, cause, and end in itself, is his work. […] Zarathustra created this most calamitous error, morality; consequently, he must also be the first to recognize it. […] His doctrine, and his alone, posits truthfulness as the highest virtue; this means the opposite of the cowardice of the "idealist” who flees from reality […]—Am I understood?—The self-overcoming of morality, out of truthfulness; the self-overcoming of the moralist, into his opposite—into me—that is what the name of Zarathustra means in my mouth.

Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra	I teach you the overman.  Man is something that shall be overcome.  What have you done to overcome him?"All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man?  A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the overman: a laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.  Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape."Whoever is the wisest among you is also a mere conflict and cross between plant and ghost.  But do I bid you become ghosts or plants?"Behold, I teach you the overman! The overman is the meaning of the earth.  Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth! I beseech you, my brothers, remain faithful to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not. Despisers of life are they, decaying and poisoned themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so let them go!"

Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra	[F]or what constitutes the tremendous historical uniqueness of that [[Persian people|Persian]] is just the opposite of this. Zarathustra was the first to consider the fight of good and evil the very wheel in the machinery of things: the transposition of morality into the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realm, as a force, cause, and end in itself, is his work. […] Zarathustra created this most calamitous error, morality; consequently, he must also be the first to recognize it. […] His doctrine, and his alone, posits truthfulness as the highest virtue; this means the opposite of the cowardice of the "idealist” who flees from reality […]—Am I understood?—The self-overcoming of morality, out of truthfulness; the self-overcoming of the moralist, into his opposite—into me—that is what the name of Zarathustra means in my mouth.

Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra	I teach you the overman.  Man is something that shall be overcome.  What have you done to overcome him?"All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man?  A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the overman: a laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.  Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape."Whoever is the wisest among you is also a mere conflict and cross between plant and ghost.  But do I bid you become ghosts or plants?"Behold, I teach you the overman! The overman is the meaning of the earth.  Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth! I beseech you, my brothers, remain faithful to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not.

Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra	I teach you the overman.  Man is something that shall be overcome.  What have you done to overcome him?"All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man?  A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the overman: a laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.  Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape."Whoever is the wisest among you is also a mere conflict and cross between plant and ghost.  But do I bid you become ghosts or plants?"Behold, I teach you the overman! The overman is the meaning of the earth.  Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth! I beseech you, my brothers, remain faithful to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not. Despisers of life are they, decaying and poisoned themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so let them go!"

Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra	[F]or what constitutes the tremendous historical uniqueness of that [[Persian people|Persian]] is just the opposite of this. Zarathustra was the first to consider the fight of good and evil the very wheel in the machinery of things: the transposition of morality into the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realm, as a force, cause, and end in itself, is his work. […] Zarathustra created this most calamitous error, morality; consequently, he must also be the first to recognize it. […] His doctrine, and his alone, posits truthfulness as the highest virtue; this means the opposite of the cowardice of the "idealist” who flees from reality […]—Am I understood?—The self-overcoming of morality, out of truthfulness; the self-overcoming of the moralist, into his opposite—into me—that is what the name of Zarathustra means in my mouth.

Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra	I teach you the overman.  Man is something that shall be overcome.  What have you done to overcome him?"All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man?  A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the overman: a laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.  Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape."Whoever is the wisest among you is also a mere conflict and cross between plant and ghost.  But do I bid you become ghosts or plants?"Behold, I teach you the overman! The overman is the meaning of the earth.  Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth! I beseech you, my brothers, remain faithful to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not. Despisers of life are they, decaying and poisoned themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so let them go!"

Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra	[F]or what constitutes the tremendous historical uniqueness of that [[Persian people|Persian]] is just the opposite of this. Zarathustra was the first to consider the fight of good and evil the very wheel in the machinery of things: the transposition of morality into the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realm, as a force, cause, and end in itself, is his work. […] Zarathustra created this most calamitous error, morality; consequently, he must also be the first to recognize it. […] His doctrine, and his alone, posits truthfulness as the highest virtue; this means the opposite of the cowardice of the "idealist” who flees from reality […]—Am I understood?—The self-overcoming of morality, out of truthfulness; the self-overcoming of the moralist, into his opposite—into me—that is what the name of Zarathustra means in my mouth.

Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra	I teach you the overman.  Man is something that shall be overcome.  What have you done to overcome him?"All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man?  A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the overman: a laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.  Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape."Whoever is the wisest among you is also a mere conflict and cross between plant and ghost.  But do I bid you become ghosts or plants?"Behold, I teach you the overman! The overman is the meaning of the earth.  Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth! I beseech you, my brothers, remain faithful to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not.

Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra	I teach you the overman.  Man is something that shall be overcome.  What have you done to overcome him?"All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man?  A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the overman: a laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.  Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape."Whoever is the wisest among you is also a mere conflict and cross between plant and ghost.  But do I bid you become ghosts or plants?"Behold, I teach you the overman! The overman is the meaning of the earth.  Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth! I beseech you, my brothers, remain faithful to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not. Despisers of life are they, decaying and poisoned themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so let them go!"

Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra	With [Thus Spoke Zarathustra] I have given mankind the greatest present that has ever been made to it so far. This book, with a voice bridging centuries, is not only the highest book there is, the book that is truly characterized by the air of the heights—the whole fact of man lies beneath it at a tremendous distance—it is also the deepest, born out of the innermost wealth of truth, an inexhaustible well to which no pail descends without coming up again filled with gold and goodness.

Trouble_in_Triplicate	I gazed at my boss in bitter disgust. He had lost all sense of proportion.

Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra	[F]or what constitutes the tremendous historical uniqueness of that [[Persian people|Persian]] is just the opposite of this.
