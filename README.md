This is a student project by me. The goal is to learn datalog rules from knowledge graphs such as yago or dbpedia under the partial completeness assumptions. You find here my modified code of prosynth and some experimental data. To test it on your own system use the docker file to set it up.

It uses prosynth (https://github.com/petablox/popl2020-artifact), souffle(https://github.com/souffle-lang/souffle) to recreate AMIE(https://github.com/lajus/amie). Many thanks to the developers of these programs.
